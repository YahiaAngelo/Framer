## Clean Architecture Guidelines

This project follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entities (no Flutter dependencies)
- **Data Layer**: Data sources and repository implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: UI and state management

When adding features:
1. Start with the domain layer (entities, use cases)
2. Implement the data layer (repositories)
3. Finally implement the presentation layer (UI, providers)

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Examples:
```
Add frame rotation feature

- Add rotation slider to controls
- Implement rotation in image processing
- Update tests

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Run `flutter test` to execute tests
